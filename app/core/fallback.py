"""Gemini-primary → third-party fallback chain.

The gateway serves Gemini models by default. When a Gemini-backed request fails
(error / exhausted account failover) or returns an *empty* response, the same
request is retried natively against the third-party providers the operator has
added to the API-key pool. The client only ever sees one model name, so
reliability is handled transparently inside the gateway — no client-side
switching required, and it applies to ANY Gemini model (flash / pro / thinking).

Selection is automatic and provider-agnostic:
  * candidates come from whatever the operator added to the API-key pool;
  * obviously non-chat models (image / video / audio / embedding ...) are skipped
    so a text/tool request never falls back onto an image model;
  * the remaining candidates are tried in random order, and a candidate that
    errors or returns nothing is skipped for the next one ("one fails → try
    another") until one succeeds.

Config (see app.config.Settings):
    FALLBACK_ENABLED  master on/off switch (default off → zero behaviour change)
    FALLBACK_MODELS   OPTIONAL override. Leave empty to auto-use every suitable
                      third-party in the pool. Set a comma-separated, ordered
                      list to pin specific models (tried in the given order).
